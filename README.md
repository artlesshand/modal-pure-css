# Modal [Pure CSS]
There are a bunch of methods that you can create modals and accordions with it in Pure CSS. in this sample I'm using `:target` to simulate the `toggle` in jQuery.

#modal-single.html

A simple modal with a close button. [method: `:target`]


#modal-grid.html
A bit more complex modal (accordion), actually the same method with different design approach [method: `:target`]

Note: I'll update this repo with more methods to create a Pure CSS Modal.
